CLOSED SERVER
=============

The Palace closed server allows only clients providing the correct username and 
password to enter. Clients will be allowed a variable number of attempts 
(authattempts). After those attempts, if a valid username and password have not 
been entered, the client will receive an error message.

The closed server consists of the server, an authentication daemon and the 
client. The Palace client must support the closed server, or they will not be 
able to connect. 

GOD COMMANDS
=============
  
    `security authhost:authport [AUTHATTEMPTS]
    `securesite on|off  

To specify the server running the authentication daemon, and the authattempts, 
for The Palace server, type:
`security hostpc.com:2345 3

To activate the security feature after you have specified the daemon, type: 
`securesite on 

SCRIPT COMMANDS:
===============

AUTHHOST    In a Unix server this is the host used for authentication. Use 
        a DNS name or IP address to refer to the authentication 
        daemon.
AUTHPORT    The authentication host’s port. 
AUTHATTEMPTS    Number of incorrect attempts to allow before disconnecting

The external authentication daemon runs on AUTHHOST, listening on AUTHPORT for a 
connection.

AUTHENTICATOR.PL
=================

The Palace authentication daemon is a PERL script distributed in tar.gz format.  
Run gunzip to uncompress the tar image file. 

    % gunzip authenticator.tar.gz

The preceding step produces a single file authenticator.tar. To extract the 
authentication source file, use tar with the extract (-x) and the filename (-f) 
options. For example:

    % tar -xf authenticator.tar

To run the authentication daemon, first navigate to the directory where you have 
installed authenticator.pl. Type: 

    % perl authenticator.pl &

The default port for the authentication daemon is 2345. You can change the 
default port by editing the authenticator.pl script. 

Set the usernames and passwords of people to connect to your server in the 
palace_passwd text file. These values should be set in the format specified 
below. The color field will be used to implement groups in later versions. 

USERNAME:PASSWORD:BLUE


USING ANOTHER AUTHENTICATION DAEMON
===================================

You may use another authentication daemon, but it must respond to the following 
parameters:

After querying the client for a username and password, the server connects to 
the authentication daemon and sends a message in the following format:
    <number>:<number>:<username>:<password>\n
The numbers should be saved, but not interpreted; They are used by The Palace 
server to match responses with requests. The password is transmitted with the 
case preserved.  The line is terminated with a newline.

The authentication daemon should verify the username and password and respond 
with:
    <length byte><number>:<number>:<auth>:<groups>
The length byte is the length of the rest of the response.  The first two 
numbers are the identification numbers supplied with the request. 
Auth should be '1' if the user is authorized, '0' otherwise.  
Groups will include a colon-separated list of groups the user is a member of. 
The groups will only appear if the user is authorized. Full group implementation 
will appear in future versions.

USING AUTHENTICATION FROM THE CLIENT
====================================
The closed server-enabled client will present the user with a dialog box for
entering their username and password.  Web authors can also specify this 
information from within the standard palace URL specification as follows:

    palcace://username:password@host:port
